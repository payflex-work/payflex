/**
 * The original build brief said BVN verification
 * checks both the number AND the submitted name, and asks for "at least
 * one automated test for the deliberate-mismatch case (valid persona BVN
 * + wrong name)" since it's supposedly deterministic in sandbox.
 *
 * This script runs exactly that scenario end to end against the live
 * sandbox: a user registered under a name that does NOT match BVN
 * 22222222222 (which belongs to "Samson Jabo" — see kyc/bvn-lookup),
 * carried through owner-wallet + CNGN smart-wallet provisioning, then
 * POST onboarding/start-nigeria with that real BVN.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — what we actually found (2026-09-04), and why this is a
 * script with a loud PASS/WARNING report rather than a Jest test that
 * silently asserts one direction: in manual testing, this sandbox's
 * start-nigeria did NOT synchronously reject the mismatch — it returned
 * 200 with a workflowId, and onboarding/status's anchorStatus flipped to
 * "active" immediately, exactly as it does for a correctly-matched name.
 * That's a real, compliance-relevant deviation from what the brief
 * describes, not a bug in this codebase — see backend/README.md "Phase 2
 * findings". It's possible BMONI enforces the name match later,
 * asynchronously, out-of-band from this endpoint (e.g. a subsequent
 * kyc.action_required webhook) — this script only checks the synchronous
 * response, which is all that's observable without a live webhook
 * receiver wired to a public URL.
 *
 * Run with: npm run sandbox:kyc-mismatch
