/**
 * PayFlex's own BMONI account — a business/platform wallet, not a user
 * wallet. This is the ONE deliberate exception to "never generate/store
 * keys outside bmoni_embedded_sdk" (see the project README):
 * that rule protects END-USER key custody, where signing must happen
 * on-device because only the user should ever be able to authorize their
 * own funds moving. A loan disbursement is the opposite case — it's
 * PayFlex's own money, moving under PayFlex's own authority, with no
 * user present to sign anything. Something has to hold that key
 * server-side for that to be possible at all.
 *
 * PRODUCTION WARNING: `PAYFLEX_TREASURY_OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY` in a plain env
 * var is fine for this sandbox build and nothing else. A real deployment
 * must hold this in a proper KMS/HSM (AWS KMS, GCP Cloud KMS, etc.) and
 * sign through that service's API rather than materializing the raw key
 * in application memory at all. Treat `signingKey` below as the one place
 * that assumption would need to change.
 *
 * Config is validated lazily (on first real use), not in the
 * constructor: this service is wired into the same AppModule every
 * sandbox script and the HTTP server boot through, including
 * `scripts/provision-treasury.ts` itself, which creates the treasury
 * BMONI account these env vars point at in the first place. Throwing
 * eagerly here would make it impossible to ever run that script.
