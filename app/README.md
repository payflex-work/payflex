# PayFlex mobile app (Flutter)

Phase 1: create a PayFlex account, provision an on-device EVM owner
wallet via `bmoni_embedded_sdk`, and provision a managed smart wallet —
mirroring backend/scripts/sandbox-lifecycle.ts but through the real UI and
real on-device signing instead of a simulated signer.

Phase 2: a KYC wizard mirroring the backend's fixed call order (options ->
occupations -> 3 documents -> profile PATCH -> readiness -> activate),
then NGN or USD rail onboarding depending on which currency the Phase 1
wallet was created for, then a wallet home screen with real balances and
transaction history.

Phase 3: send money directly (by PayTag, BMONI user ID, or raw wallet
address), QR Pay (generate a QR to receive, or scan one to pay), and a
PayTag registration screen — all resolving to the same sign/submit flow
via `lib/services/transfer_flow.dart`.

Phase 4: savings goals (create a goal, pay a due contribution), loans
(apply, see the credit-scoring result, pay a repayment), and agent mode
(toggle agent status, cash-in/cash-out, view your ledger) — all built on
the same transfer sign/submit flow. Loan disbursement is the one
exception: it's signed by PayFlex's own treasury account server-side, so
there's nothing to sign on the borrower's side for that particular step.

Phase 5: split bills (create one with contributors by PayTag, each pays
their own share), send-via-link (a known recipient gets a plain transfer;
an unknown one routes through PayFlex's own escrow — see the in-app
notice before you assume that's "just like QR Pay"), a light CAD/EUR/MXN
stub screen, and retry/offline handling on the QR-scan-to-pay flow and
the wallet home's initial load.

## Run

This repo currently holds only the Dart application code (`lib/` +
`pubspec.yaml`) — there is no `flutter create` in this environment, so the
`android/`/`ios/` platform folders don't exist yet. One-time setup on a
machine with the Flutter SDK installed:

```bash
flutter create --org com.payflex --project-name payflex .   # adds android/ios/ without touching lib/ or pubspec.yaml
flutter pub get

# Camera permission is required for the Phase 2 KYC capture screens
# (image_picker) AND Phase 3's QR scanner (mobile_scanner reuses the same
# permission) — add to android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:
#   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
# and to ios/Runner/Info.plist:
#   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
#   <string>PayFlex needs your camera to verify your identity documents and scan payment QR codes.</string>

# Point at your locally running backend (see ../backend/README.md).
# 10.0.2.2 is the Android emulator's alias for the host's localhost;
# use localhost for iOS simulator, or your LAN IP for a physical device.
flutter run --dart-define=BACKEND_BASE_URL=http://10.0.2.2:3000
```

## Design system (UI/UX & Motion Design Brief v2)

The visual layer implements the root README's "Safebox and payment safety"
guidance — "premium private
bank meets modern fintech," built off the approved logo (QR-corners +
flowing-arrow mark, blue→emerald gradient, deep navy base).

- **Design tokens** — `lib/theme/payflex_tokens.dart` is the only place hex
  codes, radii (12/16/24), spacing, motion durations/curves and shadows
  live. `lib/theme/payflex_theme.dart` builds both fully-designed light
  (off-white forms) and dark (navy wallet chrome) themes; default launch
  mode is dark, toggleable in Settings. No colored shadows, no glow: every
  shadow is a small, low-opacity, neutral elevation (`PfShadow`).
- **Signature motif** — `lib/widgets/pf_mark.dart` authors the flowing
  ribbon + arrowhead as vector geometry (a code-drawn stand-in for the logo
  PNG so it can draw itself). Used as the branded loader
  (`pf_motion.dart`), the transfer-confirmation draw-in and success mark
  (`pf_flow.dart`), the flat wallet-home watermark, and thin accent lines.
  The approved logo PNG itself ships as `assets/brand/payflex_logo.png`
  (registered in `pubspec.yaml`) for splash/header/receipt lockups.
- **Component library** — `pf_balance_card.dart` (gradient balance card
  with the once-per-session count-up reveal), `pf_buttons.dart` (gradient
  primary + quiet secondary), `pf_flow.dart` (confirmation animation +
  official `PfReceiptScreen` + generic success dialog), `pf_states.dart`
  (designed empty/error states, status chips, progress bars, split-bill
  progress ring, step headers), `pf_motion.dart`.
- **Money formatting** — `lib/utils/money.dart` is the single shared
  formatter (symbol, thousands separators, consistent decimals);
  `lib/utils/format.dart` handles timestamps/ids. No screen formats money
  inline.
- **Signature animations** (brief §2, all reusable): balance count-up on
  wallet-home load; ribbon draw-in + settle on every transfer payoff
  (Send, QR Pay, savings, loans, agent, split-bill, send-via-link); QR
  scanner→confirm shared-element morph on the QR frame (Hero tag
  `pf-qr-frame`); one consistent fade-up route transition app-wide;
  branded ribbon loader everywhere a spinner used to be; flat gradient
  progress rings on split bills. No glow, no confetti, no blocking
  animations.
- **Business-touch screens** (brief §3): receipts on every money flow,
  designed empty/error states app-wide, step-by-step onboarding/KYC
  progress, and a real `SettingsScreen` (account tier + verification badge
  from live onboarding status, appearance toggle, security posture,
  support, sign out).

> **Design layer not yet run.** Same caveat as the rest of the app — this
> environment has no Flutter/Dart SDK, so none of the above has been
> through `flutter analyze` or a device run. The palette/geometry/motion
> code is written against Flutter >=3.29 APIs only; run `flutter analyze`
> and walk the flows on a device before trusting the look.

## Architecture

- The app **never** calls BMONI directly. Every network call goes through
  `lib/services/api_client.dart`, which talks only to the PayFlex backend.
  The backend owns the single `BmoniClientService` — see
  `../backend/src/bmoni/`.
- The app **never** generates keys or signs anything itself outside
  `lib/services/wallet_service.dart`, which is a thin wrapper around
  `bmoni_embedded_sdk`. The private key never leaves the device; only the
  public owner address and EIP-191 signatures are sent to the backend.
- `lib/services/local_user_store.dart` persists the local PayFlex user id
  (`SharedPreferences`) so the app skips straight to the wallet home screen
  on relaunch instead of re-running account creation.
- Every `/users/:id/...` route now requires a valid access token (see
  "Authentication" below and `../backend/README.md`'s matching section).
  `lib/services/session_manager.dart` owns the login lifecycle;
  `ApiClient` attaches `Authorization: Bearer <token>` to every request
  from a static field, since every screen constructs its own
  `ApiClient()` instance rather than sharing one.

## Flow implemented

1. `CreateUserScreen` — collects firstName/lastName/email/phoneNumber (E.164),
   posts to the backend's `POST /users`.
2. `PinAndWalletScreen` — sets a 6-digit PIN (`BmoniEmbeddedSdk.setPin`),
   provisions an on-device owner wallet (`BmoniEmbeddedSdk.initWallet`),
   registers the address with the backend using the one-time bootstrap
   token from step 1, **immediately logs in for real**
   (`SessionManager.login` — the bootstrap token is scoped to that one
   owner-address call and nothing else), then lets the user pick a
   supported stablecoin, requests an owner-proof challenge, signs it
   on-device (`BmoniEmbeddedSdk.signMessage`), and submits the signature
   to create the managed smart wallet.
3. `KycWizardScreen` (Phase 2) — personal info + address + employment form,
   camera capture + upload for the identification document, proof of
   address, and a selfie, a readiness check, then KYC activation. Two
   confirmed-live quirks this screen deliberately works around (see
   `../backend/README.md` "Phase 2 findings" for the full detail):
   the identification-document type enum shown in the picker is the one
   the *upload* endpoint accepts, not `GET kyc/options`' `identificationTypes`
   (they don't match); and `sumsubLevelName` is hardcoded to
   `"id-and-liveness"` with a comment explaining that BMONI's valid-value
   set for that field is dynamic, and a 400 will surface the current set
   verbatim if this ever stops working.
4. Rail onboarding, branching on the wallet's currency: a BVN field for
   NGN (`POST start-nigeria`, then polling `onboarding/status` until
   `anchorStatus` is `"active"` — confirmed live to take a few seconds,
   not instant), or a single button for USD (`POST start-usa`) — **the USD
   path cannot be completed from an emulator with a placeholder image**;
   BMONI runs a real Sumsub check and returns 422
   `BAD_SELFIE`/`DOCUMENT_PAGE_MISSING` against anything that isn't an
   actual photo, so this needs a real device camera to verify.
5. `WalletHomeScreen` — real balances, a transaction history screen per
   wallet, and (Phase 3) Send / QR Pay / PayTag entry points.
6. `SendMoneyScreen` (Phase 3) — pick a recipient by PayTag, BMONI user
   ID, or raw address, then `ApiClient.createTransfer` +
   `transfer_flow.dart`'s shared sign/submit helper.
7. `QrPayScreen` (Phase 3) — "My QR" generates and displays a short-lived
   token as a QR code (`qr_flutter`); "Scan to pay" (`mobile_scanner`)
   decodes one and runs the same sign/submit flow. **Critical and
   non-obvious**: the value actually signed is `signingPayloadHash` from
   the backend's sign-payload response, taken as a **raw digest** via
   `WalletService.signDigest` (→ `BmoniEmbeddedSdk.signTransactionHash`)
   — NOT an EIP-712 hash computed from the accompanying `typedData`
   object, even though BMONI hands back a full EIP-712 structure that
   looks like it wants one. This was confirmed against the live sandbox:
   signing the properly-computed EIP-712 digest was tested and BMONI
   rejected it ("signature does not match your registered owner
   address"); signing `signingPayloadHash` directly was accepted. See
   `../backend/README.md` "Phase 3 findings" for the full story — getting
   this backwards produces a signature that fails with a generic mismatch
   error and no hint the digest itself was wrong.
8. `PayTagScreen` (Phase 3) — register/view the current user's `@handle`.
9. `SavingsScreen` (Phase 4) — create a goal, see due contributions, pay
   one via the shared sign/submit helper. A contribution only ever
   appears here because the backend's hourly scheduler marked it due —
   nothing executes without the user opening the app and signing it (see
   `../backend/README.md` "Phase 4 findings" for why that's a real
   constraint of BMONI's signing model, not a corner we cut).
10. `LoansScreen` (Phase 4) — apply for a loan and see the credit-scoring
    result immediately (approved+disbursed, or rejected, with the score);
    pay a repayment via the same sign/submit helper. Disbursement itself
    needs no action here — PayFlex's treasury signs that server-side.
11. `AgentScreen` (Phase 4) — toggle agent status, cash-in (you're the
    sender — you received physical cash) or cash-out (the current user is
    the sender — they're handing digital funds to an agent for cash), and
    view the agent's own transaction ledger.
12. `SplitBillScreen` (Phase 5) — create a bill with contributors named
    by PayTag; each contributor sees their own pending share and pays it
    via the shared sign/submit helper, same as any other transfer.
13. `SendViaLinkScreen` (Phase 5) — a Send tab (plain transfer if you give
    a known recipient's BMONI user ID; otherwise an escrow proposal you
    sign, plus a claim token to share) and a Claim tab (preview a token's
    amount/sender/status, then claim once you have a wallet in that
    currency). **This screen shows an explicit on-screen notice about the
    escrow** before the user sends to an unknown recipient — see
    `../backend/README.md` and the `ClaimableLink` model's doc comment in
    `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` for why this isn't "just a feature":
    PayFlex is holding a real customer's funds in its own account for as
    long as a link sits unclaimed.
14. `StubRailsScreen` (Phase 5) — a plain "coming soon" list for
    CAD/EUR/MXN, matching the build brief's own reduced ambition for
    these three rails ("structurally wired but not UI-polished").

## Authentication

The build brief's phases shipped with no auth at all; this closes that gap
by reusing the on-device EVM owner key every user already has, rather than
adding a separate password/OTP system. Full design/verification detail is
in `../backend/README.md`'s "Authentication" section — this is the
app-side summary.

- **`ApiClient.accessToken`/`refreshToken`** are static fields (not
  instance fields) because every screen constructs its own `ApiClient()`
  — an instance field would make a fresh, unauthenticated client on every
  screen. `SessionManager` is the only thing meant to write them (besides
  the bootstrap-token special case handled inline in
  `ApiClient.setOwnerAddress`).
- **`SessionManager.login(appUserId, pin)`** does the full
  challenge → on-device sign (`WalletService.signChallenge`) → login, then
  persists the resulting refresh token to `SharedPreferences` so the next
  cold start can skip the PIN prompt.
- **`SessionManager.tryRestoreSession()`** silently exchanges a persisted
  refresh token for a fresh access/refresh pair — no PIN needed. Returns
  `false` (session left cleared) if there's no stored token or the backend
  rejects it, so callers know to fall back to a real login.
- **`_StartupGate`** (`main.dart`) tries `tryRestoreSession()` first; on
  failure, it checks whether this device already has a wallet+PIN
  (`WalletService.hasWallet`/`hasPin`) and, if so, routes to
  `UnlockScreen` for a PIN-triggered `SessionManager.login`. If neither a
  session nor a local wallet exists, it falls back to `CreateUserScreen`
  — `POST /users` is idempotent by phone/email, so this resumes the same
  backend account rather than forking a new one; it just can't skip the
  on-device wallet/PIN setup, since a wallet was never created on *this*
  device to log in with.
- **No settings/logout UI yet** — `SessionManager.logout()` exists
  (clears the in-memory tokens and the persisted refresh token) but
  nothing in the UI calls it. Wiring it up belongs with the "real
  settings/profile screen" work described in the root README, not
  this pass.

## Error handling, retry, and offline (Phase 5 polish)

- `lib/services/retry.dart`'s `withRetry` retries only transport-level
  failures (no connection, DNS failure, timeout) a few times before
  giving up — never a real server-returned error, since retrying a
  400/404 changes nothing. Wired into the QR-scan-to-pay flow (the build
  brief's explicit example — scanning indoors with a weak signal
  shouldn't force a full re-scan) and the wallet home's initial load.
  Not swept across every other screen's network calls in this pass.
- Every other screen's `catch (e)` just surfaces `e.toString()` — for an
  `ApiException` that's the backend's real message (which, for a
  `BmoniApiError`, is BMONI's own message via the backend's
  `GlobalExceptionFilter` — see `../backend/README.md`); there's no
  attempt at friendlier copy per error type beyond the QR/wallet-home
  offline case above.

## Explicitly deferred

NFC and audio-chirp transfer are out of scope for the first working build —
flagged as future work, not attempted here.
