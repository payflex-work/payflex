# PayFlex

A mobile-first microfinance app (in the spirit of Moniepoint / OPay) built
on top of the **BMONI Embedded API** for identity, wallets, KYC, and money
movement. PayFlex adds a savings/micro-loan layer, an agent cash-in/cash-out
network, and a QR-first transfer UX on top of BMONI's smart-wallet rails.

Full spec: [`docs/BUILD_PROMPT.md`](docs/BUILD_PROMPT.md). This README
tracks what's actually been built against that spec.

All five build phases are implemented and, with the exceptions called out
per-phase below (USD KYC needing a real device camera; a few endpoints
this sandbox genuinely can't complete — crypto deposit, NGN bank
verification, CAD/EUR/MXN), verified end to end against the live BMONI
sandbox rather than mocked. The Flutter app has not been run on an actual
device/emulator in this environment — see the note near the bottom.

## Architecture, in one paragraph

BMONI Embedded is **not** built on Stellar — it's EVM-based managed smart
wallets (owner-proof challenge + EIP-191 signing) backed by regional
stablecoins (`USDB`, `CNGN`, `CADC`, `EURe`, `MEXe`). BMONI is the only
settlement rail in this build; nothing here talks to Stellar/Horizon/Soroban.
The Flutter app never calls BMONI directly and never touches key material
itself — it goes through the NestJS backend's single `BmoniClientService`
for every API call, and through `bmoni_embedded_sdk` for every key
generation / signing operation.

## Where the BMONI API boundary actually is

Future contributors need to know what's a real BMONI capability vs. what
PayFlex built on top, because the two are easy to conflate once it's all
behind one app UI.

**Real BMONI functionality** (backend/src/bmoni/ wraps all of it):
user creation, on-device owner-wallet proof + managed smart wallets, the
KYC document/readiness/activation wizard, per-currency rail onboarding
(NGN/USD/CAD/EUR/MXN), wallet balances/detail, deposits, virtual bank
accounts, NGN bank withdrawal, general bank payouts, currency exchange,
the proposal → sign-payload → sign transfer primitive, and transaction
history.

**PayFlex-built, no BMONI equivalent** (all app-layer, on top of the
transfer primitive above):
- **Lending/credit scoring** — BMONI has no loan product; scoring is a
  pluggable `CreditScoringStrategy` reading BMONI transaction history.
  **Done** (Phase 4), including automatic disbursement — see below for
  why that's the one place PayFlex signs a transfer itself.
- **Savings goals** — an app-level ledger with scheduled transfers; there
  is no on-chain escrow or smart-contract savings feature in BMONI.
  **Done** (Phase 4) — "scheduled" means the backend marks a contribution
  due, not that it executes unattended; see below for why.
- **Agent cash-in/cash-out** — BMONI has no agent-network concept; both
  directions are ordinary transfers with a separate reconciliation
  ledger. **Done** (Phase 4).
- **Bill payments** (airtime, electricity, ...) — stubbed behind an
  `IBillPaymentProvider` interface for a real aggregator later.
- **Claimable payment links for non-users** — BMONI has no
  claimable-balance primitive. Funds for a recipient without a BMONI
  account sit in PayFlex's own treasury account (the same one loan
  disbursement uses) until the recipient onboards and claims them.
  **This is a real liability/compliance surface, not a shortcut** —
  while a link is `ESCROWED`, PayFlex is holding a real customer's funds
  in its own custodial account; a production deployment needs to
  reconcile and disclose that balance per whatever e-money/custody
  regulation applies in its jurisdiction, for as long as it sits
  unclaimed. **Done** (Phase 5), including a live-verified claim where
  the treasury signs the release server-side — see
  `backend/prisma/schema.prisma`'s `ClaimableLink` doc comment and
  `backend/README.md` "Phase 5 findings" before touching this code.
- **PayTag directory** (`@handle` → `bmoniUserId`) — our own Postgres
  table, resolved before every transfer that uses it. **Done** (Phase 3).
- **QR Pay** — a short-lived, HMAC-signed QR payload naming a
  recipient/amount/currency; scanning hands off to the same transfer
  primitive below. **Done** (Phase 3).
- **Split-bill orchestration** — BMONI has no group-payment primitive;
  it's independent per-contributor proposals tracked in our own table.
  **Done** (Phase 5).

## Build status

| Phase | Status |
|---|---|
| 1 — Foundation (user + owner wallet + managed smart wallet) | **Done, verified against the live sandbox** — see `backend/README.md` |
| 2 — KYC + onboarding (NGN, USD) | **Done for NGN, verified against the live sandbox; USD wired but blocked on a real device camera** — see below |
| 3 — Transfers (QR, PayTag, deposits, NGN withdrawal) | **Transfers/QR/PayTag done, verified against the live sandbox; deposits and NGN withdrawal wired but blocked on sandbox limitations** — see below |
| 4 — Microfinance layer (savings, loans, agent mode) | **Done, verified against the live sandbox — including a real server-side treasury signature for loan disbursement** — see below |
| 5 — Polish (split-bill, send-via-link/escrow, CAD/EUR/MXN stubs) | **Split-bill and send-via-link/escrow done, verified against the live sandbox; CAD/EUR/MXN are light stubs and error/retry/offline polish is applied selectively, both by design** — see below |

Phase 1 was run end-to-end against `https://embedded-dev.bmoni.com` (not
mocked): user creation, on-device owner wallet, owner-proof challenge,
EIP-191 signing, and managed smart wallet creation all round-tripped
successfully, and the resulting rows are persisted correctly in Postgres.
Along the way we found and documented a handful of places where BMONI's
actual response shapes differ from a literal reading of the build brief —
see `backend/README.md` for the specifics (field names, response
envelopes, and the fact that the sandbox is a shared, multi-tenant
environment with global phone-number uniqueness).

Phase 2's NGN path was also run end-to-end against the live sandbox: the
full KYC wizard (options, occupations, all three documents, profile PATCH,
readiness, activation), `start-nigeria`, and wallet home (wallets,
balances, transaction history) all round-trip successfully. The USD path
is wired identically in the backend and Flutter wizard, but BMONI's USD
onboarding runs a real Sumsub identity check that rejects a synthetic test
image — completing it needs an actual photorealistic ID/selfie capture
from a real device, which this environment can't provide. Also worth
flagging: a deliberately mismatched name against a real BVN was **not**
rejected by `start-nigeria` in three separate live test runs, contradicting
the build brief's description of that check — see `backend/README.md`
"Phase 2 findings" before treating that endpoint as a compliance control.

Phase 3's transfer primitive (create proposal → sign-payload → sign),
QR Pay, and PayTag were all run end-to-end against the live sandbox: two
users provisioned, a PayTag registered and resolved, a direct
PayTag-addressed transfer signed, and a QR-Pay-generated transfer signed
by the scanning "payer." The single most important finding from this
phase: the value BMONI actually wants signed is a raw digest
(`signingPayloadHash`) it returns alongside a full EIP-712 `typedData`
structure — signing the *properly computed* EIP-712 hash of that
structure was tested against the live sandbox and **rejected**
("signature does not match your registered owner address"); signing
`signingPayloadHash` directly was accepted. Also found and fixed: several
proposal endpoint paths in the build brief don't exist at all (there is
no "approve" endpoint anywhere in BMONI's API — signing a proposal *is*
the approval), and BMONI's own OpenAPI spec (served at
`/docs/openapi.json` on the sandbox host, undocumented in the brief) is a
much better starting point than guessing but is itself not fully in sync
with live behavior. See `backend/README.md` "Phase 3 findings" for the
complete list. Deposits and NGN bank withdrawal are wired and typed
against confirmed request/response shapes but not verified end-to-end:
crypto deposit 502'd from BMONI's own upstream bridge provider on every
attempt, and NGN account verification needs a real NUBAN this sandbox has
no test value for.

Phase 4 (savings, loans, agent mode) needed no new BMONI endpoints — it's
all PayFlex's own logic on top of the Phase 3 transfer primitive — but
was run end-to-end against the live sandbox anyway: a savings goal
created and its first contribution signed; a loan application correctly
rejected for a fresh account (credit score 0) and, for a back-dated test
account, approved and **disbursed with PayFlex's own treasury account
signing the payout server-side** — the one place in this app where
PayFlex, not the end user, authorizes a transfer, because it's PayFlex's
own money moving under PayFlex's own authority. A key architectural
constraint worth stating plainly: BMONI's signing model has no delegated
or pre-authorized debit mechanism, so a "scheduled" savings contribution
can only ever be marked *due* by the backend — a human still has to open
the app and sign it, the same as any other transfer. See
`backend/README.md` "Phase 4 findings" for the details, including a
config-validation bug (treasury setup throwing at app-boot, which would
have made it impossible to ever provision the treasury) caught and fixed
during this phase.

Phase 5 closes out the build brief: split-bill (create a bill split
across contributors resolved by PayTag, each contributor's share an
independent signed transfer, the bill auto-completing once every share is
paid) and send-via-link were both run end-to-end against the live
sandbox, including the escrow path — an unknown recipient's funds route
into PayFlex's treasury, and a freshly-onboarded recipient claims them
with **the treasury signing the release server-side**, the same pattern
Phase 4's loan disbursement established. `HmacTokenService` was pulled
out of `QrPayService` once split-bill QR codes and claim links needed the
identical short-lived-signed-token mechanics. CAD/EUR/MXN got a light
live probe (not full verification, matching the brief's own reduced
ambition for these) confirming their real, rail-specific request bodies;
error handling was consolidated into one `GlobalExceptionFilter`; and
retry/offline handling was added to the QR-scan-to-pay flow the brief
calls out by name, plus the wallet home's initial load — not swept across
every screen. See `backend/README.md` "Phase 5 findings" for the details.

The Flutter app is scaffolded and wired for all five phases, written
against the real `bmoni_embedded_sdk` v0.0.2 API (inspected from its
pub.dev package, not guessed) and the backend's confirmed-live HTTP
contract, but **has not been run** — this environment has no Flutter/Dart
SDK installed. See `app/README.md`. On top of the five phases, the app
now carries the **UI/UX & Motion Design Brief v2** visual layer
(`docs/BUILD_PROMPT.md` §9 — design tokens, brand motif animations,
component library, receipts, settings) — also not yet run, same caveat.

## Non-negotiable engineering rules (see docs/BUILD_PROMPT.md §7)

- Every BMONI call goes through `BmoniClientService` — no ad-hoc HTTP calls
  in feature code.
- No key generation, storage, or signing outside `bmoni_embedded_sdk`.
- `bmoniUserId` is persisted on first creation, both locally on-device
  (`SharedPreferences`) and in the backend's Postgres — a user is never
  recreated on relaunch.
- KYC submit order and per-currency activation are hard constraints, not
  suggestions (Phase 2).
- All monetary amounts go through one shared money-formatting utility
  (`backend/src/common/money.util.ts`) rather than inline conversions.
- A webhook receiver (`POST /webhooks/bmoni`) logs and persists every
  BMONI async event from Phase 1 onward, even before all event types are
  acted on.
